## Screen 1 — `login_screen.dart`

**Purpose:** Entry point. User inputs phone number to receive OTP.

### UI Components
- Transparent AppBar or no AppBar

- Full-width "Send OTP" button — background `primary600`, white text
- Background color `background` (white), light decorative accent using `primary50`

### Logic
- Validate phone number is not empty and has at least 9 digits
- On button tap → call Firebase Auth `verifyPhoneNumber()`
- Store the received `verificationId` from Firebase
- Navigate to `register_screen.dart` passing the `verificationId`

### Navigation
`login_screen` → `register_screen`

---

## Screen 2 — `register_screen.dart`

**Purpose:** OTP verification screen for the phone number entered on the login screen.

> Note: `register_screen` functions as the OTP Verification Screen, not a data registration form.

- "Verify" button — background `primary600`, white text; disabled (color `neutral300`) if OTP is not 6 digits

### Logic
- Auto-focus moves to the next box after each digit is entered
- When all 6 digits are filled → call `PhoneAuthProvider.credential()` then `signInWithCredential()`
- On success → check if user profile data exists in the database
  - Exists → navigate to `home_screen`
  - Does not exist → navigate to `profile_screen` for first-time setup
- On failure → show error SnackBar with color `secondary500`

### Navigation
`register_screen` → `home_screen` or `profile_screen`
